/**
 *	\file
 *	\brief Definitions of atomic (interlocked) API.
 *	
 *	Atomic (interlocked) functions are supposed to provide atomic operations on 
 *	variables in multi-threaded environment without bringing synchronization objects in.
 *	Atomic functions can be used for implementing reliable reference counting, advanced
 *	synchronization objects, complex techniques of relaxed synchronization with minimum
 *	or no synchronization obejcts' usage.
 *	
 *	All atomic functions are implemented as memory barriers.
 *
 *	On Windows, QNX, MacOS, AIX, SunOS atomic API is implemented via native OS calls.
 *	If atomic operation function are not provided (or not fully provided) by target OS,
 *	the missing operations are implemented with aid of other atomic functions or
 *	via mutex locks if that is not possible. The array of \c _OU_ATOMIC_MUTEX_COUNT 
 *	(8 in current version) mutexes is used to decrease probability of several threads 
 *	being competing for the same mutex lock and resulting necessity to block some 
 *	of them during operation.
 *
 *	All atomic API implementations are inlined, Exceptions are implementations via
 *	mutex locks for which it is not reasonable to generate inlined code.
 *
 *	Atomic functions' prototypes were selected to to provide maximal possible 
 *	functionality available on all the platforms mentioned above in common. Function
 *	names were chosen as a mix of Windows and UNIX naming traditions (more closely 
 *	to Windows though).
 *
 *	There are the following groups of API available:
 *	\li Arithmetic (\c AtomicIncrement, \c AtomicDecrement)
 *	\li Integer Exchange (\c AtomicExchange, \c AtomicExchangeAdd, \c AtomicCompareExchange)
 *	\li Bitwise (\c AtomicAnd, \c AtomicOr, \c AtomicXor)
 *	\li Pointer Exchange (\c AtomicExchangePointer, \c AtomicCompareExchangePointer)
 *	
 *	For Arithmetic and Bitwise groups along with \c AtomicExchangeAdd function there
 *	are "no result" variants available. These are written with \c NoResult suffix 
 *	after function name and may operate faster on some platforms. However they do not
 *	provide operation results.
 *
 *	Atomic functions of Arithmetic, Integer Exchange and Bitwise groups operate with
 *	32-bit values regardless if build target address space is 32 or 64 bits wide.
 *	Pointer Exchange functions operate with pointer type and their argument can be
 *	both 32 or 64 bit value depending on build target.
 *
 *	Generic x86 assembler implementation is provided for i486 and later processors. 
 *	However it is never automatically selected. You must explicitly define
 *	\c _OU_ATOMIC_USE_X86_ASSEMBLER symbol in compiler options to select that 
 *	implementation. The option can only be used if \c _OU_TARGET_OS is equal to 
 *	\c _OU_TARGET_OS_GENUNIX. If the symbol is defined for any other target, 
 *	it is silently ignored.
 *	\warning
 *	Never use assembler implementation on systems that provide native atomic API!
 *
 *	Atomic API may require initialization before first use and finalization on program
 *	exit. The initialization may be necessary when operating system does not provide
 *	sufficient functionality to implement all the operations via native calls. However,
 *	to maintain code portability it is recommended that initialization/finalization
 *	functions are always called.
 *
 *	API initialization and finalization calls use reference counting mechanism and
 *	thus may be invoked several times from different subsystems. Initialization and
 *	finalization is \e not \e thread \e safe and should be performed from main thread
 *	only.

 *	needs not necessary to be a signed integer. It might be either signed or unsigned 
 *	depending on target platform. The only information which could be relied on is
 *	that the type will always be 32 bit wide, regardless if target platform is a

 *
 *	Any arithmetic operations should be avoided with type \c atomicord32.
